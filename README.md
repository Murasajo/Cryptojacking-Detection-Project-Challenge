## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Cryptojacking Detection Challenge. The goal of this challenge is to classify network activity from various websites as either cryptojacking or not, based on features related to both network-based and host-based data.

## Problem Statement

Cryptojacking is a cyberattack that uses malicious scripts to mine cryptocurrency on other people's machines without their awareness. These attacks are difficult to detect and can lead to decreased computing speeds and system crashes due to the heavy load on computational resources.

## Objectives

- Classify network activity from various websites as either cryptojacking or not.
- Use features derived from both network-based and host-based data.
- Develop a robust model to accurately detect cryptojacking activity.

## Contents

- **Importing Libraries**: Importing necessary libraries for data processing and modeling.
- **Loading Data**: Loading and inspecting the dataset.
- **Statistical Summaries**: Generating statistical summaries of the data.
- **Missing Values and Duplicates**: Handling missing values and duplicates in the data.
- **Target Distribution**: Analyzing the distribution of the target variable.
- **Modeling**: Developing and evaluating machine learning models to classify network activity.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cryptojacking-detection.git
    cd cryptojacking-detection
    ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the notebook**:
    Open and run the `Cryptojacking_Detection_Notebook.ipynb` notebook to reproduce the analysis and model training steps.
